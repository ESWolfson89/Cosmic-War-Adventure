Requires:
SDL2

SDL2 Image library

See title screen in screenshot 4 for details on how to play, missing features, etc...

------------

To be posted:

1) Dynamic linked libraries for SDL2 and SDL2Image that are needed

2) How to compile in Code::Blocks under windows( I have not tested under linux, but will try to do so in the future so I can have compilation instructions for that too).

3) Remaining things I intend to add.
